# Ordinal-testing-example

This repository is for testing how Jest works and how to use it efficiently, adding its dependencies installed via npm.


### Instructions


1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

### 2. **Running Tests**:
    ```bash
    npm test

### 3. **Using Jest in the Project**
    * Add more tests by creating new test files under the __tests__ folder. 
    
   
    * Customize Jest configurations in jest.config.js.

### 4. **Use Watch Mode**:
    ```bash
    npm test -- --watch


This will open an interactive menu where you can choose options such as:

* a to run all tests.

* f to run only failed tests.

* p to filter by filename.

* t to filter by test name.

* q to quit Watch mode.

**Additional Benefits:**

Watch mode will allow you to instantly see changes and re-run tests as you modify files.
You can easily go back to run a specific file or group of tests without having to stop and start the tests manually.
